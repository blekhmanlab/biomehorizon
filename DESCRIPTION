Description: This package provides a toolset for visualizing longitudinal microbiome data with a horizon 
  plot. A horizon plot provides a compact method to display change in the distribution of microbial taxa 
  over time. This method is valuable for highlighting changes in individual taxa, but more importantly, 
  emphasizes broad trends among groups of taxa. This package can also be used to visualize other types of
  longitudinal data.
